    Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams.

    anything can be a stream: variables, user inputs, properties, caches, data structures, etc.

   A stream can be used as an input to another one.
   Even multiple streams can be used as inputs to another stream. 
   You can merge two streams. 

   each stream has functions attached to it sucha as map, filter, scan
    When you call one of these functions, such as clickStream.map(f), 
      it returns a new stream based on the click stream.
    It does not modify the original click stream in any way. (immutable)

   Observer design pattern
     The "listening" to the stream is called subscribing.
     The functions we are defining are observers.
     The stream is the subject (or "observable") being observed. 

   you can have multiple observer functions subscribing a string such as (click, double click, tripple click)
