Great! 

I teach in the evenings so anytime before 5:00pm would work.

General Assembly



Hello Raymond, 

As the Instructor Manager for Genearl Assembly I wanted to reach out to you dirrectly.

I came to the Bay Area a year ago to be at the center of tech education and to ultimately become a top educator in tech. 

Prior to that I was an English Teacher / Entrepreneur in Seoul Korea for seven years.

For the past year I have been lecturing nights for App Academy's bootcamp prep program.

Here are some areas where I could bring value to General Assembly as an instructor.


Technical skills
    Through platforms like Udemy, Launch School, Udacity and others, I have spent thousands of hours exploring technical topics. Here are some of them.

        year 1 -> Python, Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS
        year 2 -> SQL, Sinatra, RSpec, javaScript, jQuery, Ajax, SCSS, Flexbox, Vim
        year 3 -> NodeJs, MongoDb, MySql, React

    Currently I am most interested in:
        - Data Structures and algorithms and coaching students on technical interview preparation.
        - Building a web app that visualizes information about world cities using the React/Redux framework.


Teaching experience
    In addition to years of lecturing experience I can bring a mix of curriculum development and Entrepreneurial thinking.
    Scored above 9.0 on average NPS scores while teaching at App Academy.
    Success founding multiple meetups in both Korea and SF.


I would really appreciate the opportunity to sit down with you or someone on your team in regards to becoming a Software Engineering Immersive Instructor.

Feel free to reach out to me anytime! 


Thank you,

Galvanize


Hello Sherif,



As the Program Director at Galvanize San Francisco I wanted to reach out to you dirrectly.

I came to the Bay Area a year ago to be at the center of tech education and to ultimately become a top educator in tech. 

Prior to that I was an English Teacher / Entrepreneur in Seoul Korea for seven years.

For the past year I have been lecturing nights for App Academy's bootcamp prep program.


An initial search of open instructor positions at Galvanize shows you may not be hiring at the moment, but I would really appreciate the opportunity to sit down with you or someone on your team to ask questions for the possibility of being considered for future roles.

Specifically I would like to ask about thoughts on gaining industry experience as an engineer first, or focusing solely on becoming a better teacher.

Ultimately I plan to be an educator in tech for the longterm and would love to communicate with others in this area.

Feel free to reach out to me anytime! 


Thank you,

Hello Ashu, 


As a founder of Make School I wanted to reach out to you directly.

I came to the Bay Area a year ago to be at the center of tech education and to ultimately become a top educator in tech. 

Prior to that I was an English Teacher / Entrepreneur in Seoul Korea for seven years.

For the past year I have been lecturing nights for App Academy's bootcamp prep program.

Going forward, I hope to find an opportunity where I can have a direct impact on the reputation and ultimately the enrollment numbers of an institution.

Here are some areas where I could bring value to Make School.


Technical skills
    I began my coding journey while trying to automate processes needed for running a small business. 
    Our mission was to help Korean students connect with affordable teachers in the Philippines through video chat.
    That project has been abandoned but my curiosity for technology continues.

    Through platforms like Udemy, Launch School, Udacity and others, I have spent thousands of hours exploring technical topics.

        year 1 -> Python, Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS
        year 2 -> SQL, Sinatra, RSpec, javaScript, jQuery, Ajax, SCSS, Flexbox, Vim
        year 3 -> NodeJs, MongoDb, asynchronous programming, MySql

    Currently I am most interested in:
        - Strengthening my understanding of Data Structures and algorithms and coaching students on aspects of the technical interview.
        - Building a web app that visualizes information about world cities using the React/Redux framework.


Growth
    Some possible areas to explore for increasing Make School awareness and enrollment.
        -Produce a minimal podcast that interviews tech professionals who found their way into the field through unconventional ways.
        -Host a meetup or workshop for high school and college students exploring technology as a hobby or tool. 
        (Past experience with meetups include: Korea, SF)


Teaching
    First and foremost I consider myself a teacher.
    Lecturing is a skill that is difficult to measure, it requires the ability to constantly read and imagine what individuals might be thinking and adjust behavior.
    When an instructor shows constant focus and empathy toward students, they respond with respect and constant attention back to the instructor.
 
     
I would be grateful for the opportunity to sit down with you or someone on your team to ask questions and explore possible opportunities within your organization.
Feel free to reach out to me anytime!


Thank you,

Implementation
  Used stateless components whenever possible to better undersatnd the tradeoffs between connecting to a store, and passing down state. 
  Created a custom fuzzy dropdown that uses a prebuild trie to produce results in constant time.


Things learned while implementing this project
  

How to come up with a statement on how to reduce page loads by 95%
Where are decorators used in daily 
caches (when and what are they used for)
function vs method vs generator
  generators (when and what are they used for)
draw a relational diagram



I am really curious where you have encountered generators in the wild, I have learned some about their syntax but never actually used them.
Bind didn't really make sense to me until I actually started needing it in React apps.
I would love to talk more about the tradeoffs between using stateless components that connect to a store vs passing down state as props. Latley I have been using the store for almost everything and wonder if that could at some point become problematic.

  Short story introduction myself / this is why you want me...
  Questions about the areas that I might fit in best
  Would like to talk with your or maybe you could direct me to someone in the organization

  I belive that because of the wide variation in software roles engineering experience can not always predict industry expertise
  Teaching is somthing that is part natural and part experience, a good teacher is able to keep the attention level in the room high so that knowledge can be obsorbed more efficently.

Areas of expertice
  -Skilled and engauging lecturer, ability to speak in front of groups
  -Technical proficiency in a multiple langauges and frameworks
  -Data structures and algorithms, whiteboarding for technical interviews

Soft skills
  -Constant focus on gaining the respect of both collegues an students
  -Assessing individuals with productive honesty and positive discourse
  -Curiosity about current systems and testing the bounds of current thinking.

Full Stack Educator

Hello Elie,


As an original founder of Rithm School I wanted to reach out to you directly.

I came to the Bay Area a year ago to be at the center of tech education and to ultimately become a top educator in tech. 

Prior to that I was an English Teacher / Entrepreneur in Seoul Korea for seven years.

For the past year I have been lecturing nights for App Academy's bootcamp prep program.

Going forward, I hope to find an opportunity where I can have a direct impact on the reputation and enrollment numbers of a smaller institution.

Here are some areas where I can bring value your school.


Technical skills
    Through platforms like Udemy, Launch School, Udacity and others, I have spent thousands of hours exploring technical topics. Here are some of them.

        year 1 -> Python, Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS
        year 2 -> SQL, Sinatra, RSpec, javaScript, jQuery, Ajax, SCSS, Flexbox, Vim
        year 3 -> NodeJs, MongoDb, MySql, React

    Currently I am most interested in:

Teaching experience
    In addition to years of lecturing experience I can bring a mix of curriculum development and Entrepreneurial thinking.
    Scored above 9.0 on average NPS scores while teaching at App Academy.
    Success founding multiple meetups in both Korea and SF.


What I have learned after a year at App Academy
    Smaller class sizes are better learning environments
      On multiple occasions students have come to me with disappointment in the full time curriculum after leaving the smaller Bootcamp Prep classroom.

    Larger organizations get too comfortable to take risks and adapt to change
      There is a large disconnect when managers are in a different part of the building from the actual instruction.

    Relying on a testing culture has negative side effects
      High stress testing tends to favor students of certain backgrounds and creates a mentality of an engineering career as an intelligence test instead of a craft. 

    Teachers need to be a part of the curriculum development process
      Repetition with the curriculum and subtle experimentation with delivery is necessary for taking students to a deeper level of knowledge.
      Using former students as teachers who are still planning to become engineers results in a weaker learning environment.



I would really appreciate the opportunity to sit down with you or someone on your team to ask questions about becoming a Web Development Instructor for Rithm school.

Specifically I would like to ask about thoughts on gaining industry experience as an engineer first, or focusing solely on becoming a better teacher.

Ultimately I plan to be an educator in tech for the longterm and would love to communicate with others in this area.

Feel free to reach out to me anytime!

Hello,

I am currently working as the bootcamp prep instructor / manager for App Academy.

About a year ago I came to a workshop lead by Elie Schoppik and was really impressed with the way he handled the classroom.

After learning more about Rithm school, it feels like the organization has a lot of passion for quality education, something I think can be lacking in larger schools.

I consider myself to be a teacher first, but began coding as a hobby about four years ago.

After living in Seoul Korea as a English Teacher / Entrapaneur for seven years, I came to the Bay Area to become a top educator in tech.

I am reaching out to you because I believe I could add a lot to your organization as well as learn a lot from people who really care about education.

In addition to teaching and coding experience I also feel like I could be a generalist in finding ways to grow and improve your venture.


Here is a link to my LinkedIn and profile.

I hope I could get an opportunity to sit down with someone in the organization to ask questions and see if there could be a good fit for you team.

Thank You!

Hello Dan,

Not sure if you remember me, we had a couple conversations last year and I was fortunate enough to be able to use your classroom to host a few meetups on the topic of data structures and algorithms. 

Since that time I have been working as an instructor for App Academy and continue to focus on becoming a top educator in tech.

The reason I am reaching out to you is that I heard Sergey Piterman will be moving on from OutCo.

If you are in need of a seasoned lecturer and generalist for growing your venture, I would love to connect with you!

Feel free to contact me anytime, I am in your area daily.


Thank You,

About 4 years ago I began learning web development while teaching abroad.

I came to the Bay Area about a year ago to become a top educator in tech and am currently working as the bootcamp prep instructor / manager for App Academy.

At one point I was able to attend a workshop lead by Elie Schoppik and was really impressed by his views on education and the way he lead the classroom.

So much so that Rythm school is my primary endoursement after App Academy.

I am reaching out to you because I believe I could bring a lot to your organization. 

Not only as an instructor but as a generalist for growing and supporting your business. 

If you are in need of a seasoned lecturer I would love to connect with you!


Thank You,
